    prompt: `Summarize the following article highlighting the main benefits, challenges, and future outlook in a structured format with bullet points:\n\nCloud computing has fundamentally transformed how businesses operate by providing on-demand access to computing resources over the internet. Instead of maintaining expensive physical servers and data centers, companies can now rent computing power, storage, and applications from cloud providers like Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, and Google Cloud Platform. This shift has enabled startups to scale rapidly without massive upfront infrastructure investments, while established enterprises have reduced their IT operational costs significantly by migrating workloads to the cloud.\n\nHowever, cloud adoption comes with challenges including data security concerns, vendor lock-in risks, compliance complexities across different jurisdictions, and the need for specialized skills to manage cloud architectures. Organizations must carefully evaluate their cloud strategy, considering hybrid and multi-cloud approaches to balance flexibility with control.\n\nLooking ahead, emerging trends like edge computing, serverless architectures, and AI-powered cloud management tools are set to further revolutionize cloud services. By 2026, analysts predict that over 85% of enterprises will adopt a cloud-first strategy, with increasing focus on sustainability and carbon-neutral cloud infrastructure.`,
